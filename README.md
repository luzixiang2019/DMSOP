# Bayesian Analysis of a Dynamic Multivariate Spatial Ordered Probit Model

The computer software code and the data in section 5 of article "Bayesian Analysis of a Dynamic Multivariate Spatial Ordered Probit Model".

#### Description
This repository provides 7 files as follows:
- 6 empirical data_use.xlsx, this file includes the original 2,213 subsamples data.
- model-generated empirical data.R, this is the R code file that converts above Excel data into available R data.
- All data_use.Rdata, this is the first converted R data file.
- Weight.Rdata, this is the second converted R data file.
- Weight-original.Rdata, this is the third converted R data file.
- model-run.R, this is the R code file used to obtain the parameter estimation results. 
- results.Rdata, this is the R data file of the parameter estimation results.

#### Note
Because seeds are random, the parameter estimation results of each run are not the same, but always similar.
